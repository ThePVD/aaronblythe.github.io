 The AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty was the hardest certification I have done yet. The actual test was a 3 hour time-limit that I took from home in my 4 year old daughter's bedroom, while my other two daughters did virtual school from home. I studied for months both through videos and hands on. This is my 4th AWS Certification. I will likely do a few more certifications in 2021, as I decided to continue my goal of #continuouslearning for another year. Huge thank you to Stuart Scott of Cloud Academy, Inc. Also Frank Kane and St√©phane Maarek whose courses I accessed through Udemy and of course Amazon Web Services (AWS)
