My first semester of graduate school is complete! I finished CS 410: Text Information Systems

My final project was my first substantial project in Python. It is a sentiment analysis of twitter mentions broken down by state company and state for the airline industry. The code is available on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/aaronblythe/sentipy/) and there is a [running prototype](https://aaronblythe.gitlab.io/sentipy/) that you can play with.
