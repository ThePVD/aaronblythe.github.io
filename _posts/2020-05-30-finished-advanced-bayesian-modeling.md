I am really excited to finish CS 598/STAT 578: Advanced Bayesian Modeling. This course focused on Bayesian methodologies to model situations, really digging into Markov Chain Monte Carlo using JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) in R. This course had some of the hardest tests I have ever seen. I am proud to work through all of the challenges of this course and to learn so much. I spent over 10-15 hours on most of the assignments (which was quite similar to all of my statistics/machine learning courses in 2019).

I have one class left in this Masterâ€™s program over this summer. Another 500 level course on Data Cleaning then I am trying to figure out what is next? Probably more Machine Learning courses from other universities or programs.
