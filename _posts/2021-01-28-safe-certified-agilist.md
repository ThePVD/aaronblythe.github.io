I recently became a Certified SAFe® 5 Agilist. I completed a two-day training at work with many colleagues. Huge thank yous to #NAIC for continuing to invest in us to build a learning organization. I look forward to continually improving on our delivery.

After the course I spent a full day last weekend and 3 nights after work studying the material and did 3 practice exams on #Udemy for Business (also thanks to #NAIC). A week later after the course with everything crammed in my brain, I sat for the exam. Next step in this progression is Certified SAFe® 5 DevOps Practitioner!

Now back to studying for Cloud Certifications!
