Today I received word that I was accepted to the University of Illinois Masters of Computer Science (with emphasis in Data Science) program. Since childhood University of Illinois has been part of my dream (and apparently wardrobe). Needless to say I am very excited to be accepted to this awesome school a second time in my life.
