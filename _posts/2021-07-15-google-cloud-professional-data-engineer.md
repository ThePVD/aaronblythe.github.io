I am thrilled to disclose that I am now a Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer. This is my 3rd Google Cloud Certification and my 8th overall Cloud Certification. I did numerous videos, reading of blogs and documentation, and practice exams. I also used the awesome #Udemy course from Dan Sullivan to study. Thank you for the awesome content!
