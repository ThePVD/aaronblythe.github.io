DevOpsDays 2019 was the biggest and best yet! This year it was held at Plexpod Westport Commons which is a renovated Middle School that now serves as a coworking space on 39th street in KCMO.

The [Program](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-kansas-city/program) was jam-packed with tons of great content that was again delivered on a Jumbotron like screen.

We had many 2-hour workshops which received a lot of great feedback and gave many participants that opportunity to dig into technical topics.

We of course had great food from Joe's Kansas City BBQ. Betty Rae's showed up the second day for Ice Cream in the afternoon.

Shirts were again printed on demand on site by Seen Merch.
