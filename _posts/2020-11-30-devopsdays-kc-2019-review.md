You can see all the great Day 1 speakers on this [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j-nLifX3sA&list=PLH2p9sgqfZSdU0KHHSjIITqZF_zSEuqJ2) and all the great Day 2 speakers on this [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgnilJvbk4&list=PLH2p9sgqfZSf4q1GDYdwyYCaMlDiMDJjY).

DevOpsDays 2019 was the biggest and best yet! Over 500 atteendees made their way through the halls of [Plexpod Westport Commons](https://www.plexpod.com/locations/westport) which is a renovated Middle School that now serves as a coworking space on 39th street in KCMO.

The [Program](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-kansas-city/program) was jam-packed with tons of great content that was again delivered on a Jumbotron like screen.

We had many full and coveted [2-hour workshops](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-kansas-city/program) which received a lot of great feedback and gave many participants that opportunity to dig into technical topics. Ranging from Value Stream Mapping to AWS Dev Deep Racer and from a leadership style of putting the developer first to automating the boring stuff with Kubernetes.  Most of these were not recorded as they are part of the in-person experience.

[Open spaces](https://devopsdays.org/open-space-format/) were held in the morning rather than the afternoon for the first time and this helped to raise attendance for this in-person free flow exchange of ideas. 

We, of course, had great food from local KC companies [Joe's Kansas City BBQ](https://www.joeskc.com/) for lunch on day one and [Hawaiian Bros](https://hawaiianbros.com/) for lunch on day 2. [Betty Rae's](http://bettyraes.com/) showed up the second day for Ice Cream in the afternoon. 

We got together for a great night of games and giveaways at [No Other Pub](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-kansas-city/social)

Shirts were again printed on-demand on-site by a local amazing company [Seen Merch](https://www.seenmerch.com/).

Our graphics were created and provided by [Will Mackey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wmackeycreativarium/) an incredible local artist that we cannot say enough good things about.

We had a local podcaster [Du'an Lightfoot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeXMAP0cZ-VZ0VHX9ZV2Abw) [#labeeveryday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LabEveryday) (with over 30k YouTube subscribers) attend and do podcasts on site.

We couldn't have done any of this without all the amazing [sponsors](https://devopsdays.org/events/2019-kansas-city/welcome)!! There were over 30 sponsors contributing support to make this happen.
