This past weekend I had the opportunity to present at Tulsa Techfest. I was trying out some new material about that is a mix of fictional stories and my own personal experiences over the last decade in trying to influence culture across many teams to be more productive.

While only two people attended, we had an awesome discussion both during and after the presentation. I know this presentation needs polishing. I also think it needs more in some places and less in others, but I am not sure what.

I am putting this out here to get feedback.
