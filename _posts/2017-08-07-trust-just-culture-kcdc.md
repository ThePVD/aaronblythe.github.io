On Friday August 4th, I had the opportunity to present at KCDC. This was my second attempt at new material about that is a mix of fictional stories and my own personal experiences over the last decade in trying to influence culture across many teams to be more productive. I believe it was an improvement over the [first iteration](https://aaronblythe.github.io/culture/2017/07/26/trust-just-culture-presentation.html) 

I know this presentation needs polishing. I also think it needs more in some places and less in others, but I am not sure what. I have already submitted to other places to continue to deliver this content and I want to improve each time.

I am putting this out here to get feedback.
