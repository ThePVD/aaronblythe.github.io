First we need to export the Keynote slides to images.

![export-keynote-images]({{ site.url }}/images/imovie/export_keynote_images.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Then in iMovie import the video of the presentation.

![import]({{ site.url }}/images/imovie/import.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Then in iMovie import the entire folder of images of the slides.

![import-folder]({{ site.url }}/images/imovie/import_folder.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Drag and drop the first slide above the video.  Then pull the slide until the presenter clicks on the slide in the video.

![timeline]({{ site.url }}/images/imovie/timeline.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Use the ![crop]({{ site.url }}/images/imovie/crop.png){:class="img-responsive"} button to remove the Ken Burns effect and just select “fit”.

![fit]({{ site.url }}/images/imovie/fit.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Use the ![screen-tool]({{ site.url }}/images/imovie/screen_tool.png){:class="img-responsive"} button to change to “Picture in Picture” and resize the slide.  For the capture I have it is easy to snap to the top left corner and then snap to the center line of the screen.

![pip]({{ site.url }}/images/imovie/pip.png){:class="img-responsive"}

For the demos do not put a slide over top.  Then control-click and select "split clip at the beginning and end of the portion you want to zoom in on.

![split-clip]({{ site.url }}/images/imovie/split_clip.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Select this section of the video and use the ![crop]({{ site.url }}/images/imovie/crop.png){:class="img-responsive"} button to resize down to just the presenter and the screen.

![crop-video]({{ site.url }}/images/imovie/crop_video.png){:class="img-responsive"}
