This was an awesome project where I worked with a research group to train a supervised Convolutional Neural Network model on 122 GB of photographs from [AffectNet](http://mohammadmahoor.com/affectnet/) using PySpark, Pandas, OpenCV, Keras, NumPy, and a whole lotta cloud compute.

Check out my group's full [research paper](/images/portfolio/Oculum_afficit.pdf).
