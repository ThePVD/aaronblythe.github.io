I just completed Stat 420: Statistical Modeling in R. This course was extremely challenging over the summer (while also taking data visualization). With 10 homeworks and 10 quizzed and 2 exams in 12 weeks, there was always something due.  In this class we covered a [number of topics](http://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/index.html) including linear regression and logistic regression.  All of this course was done in the R programming language.

In our group project we used the [1990 California Housing Data Set](http://rpubs.com/ablythe/520912) to work create a predictive model.
