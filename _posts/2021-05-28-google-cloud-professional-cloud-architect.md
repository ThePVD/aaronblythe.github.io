I am delighted to reveal that I am now a Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect. This is my second Google Cloud Certification and my 7th overall Cloud Certification. I used the awesome #Udemy courses from Ranga Karanam to study. I can still hear the “welcome back” on 1.75x speed in my head and I love it! Thank you for the awesome content!
