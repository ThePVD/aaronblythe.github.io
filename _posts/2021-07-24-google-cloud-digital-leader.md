I recently became a Google Cloud Certified Cloud Digital Leader. This is the latest certification available from Google Cloud (it looks like I was #371). This exam and the associated learning revolves around guiding a business through a Digital Transformation through: 

* Innovating with Data
* Infrastructure and Application Modernization
* Cloud Security and Operations

This is my 4th Google Cloud Certification and my 9th Cloud Certification overall.
