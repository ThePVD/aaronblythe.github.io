I just completed CS 498: Applied Machine Learning and I loved every bit of it. We covered both supervised and unsupervised learning and even got into deep learning at the end.

This was the most challenging course I have taken since my senior design project in Senior year of college.  I spent on average about 10-12 hours on each assignment (some much longer).

The 10 assignments in 16 weeks included:

1. Classification w/Naive Bayes
1. Classification w/SVM
1. Smoothing Noise w/PCA
1. More PCA
1. Classifying w/Variable Length Inputs
1. Outlier Detection
1. Text bag-of-words Search and classification
1. Classification with Artificial Neural Networks
1. Variational Autoencoders
1. Deep Neural Networks (Take-home Final)

All homeworks received 100% marks.
