I just completed CS 498: Applied Machine Learning and I loved every bit of it. We covered both supervised and unsupervised learning and even got into deep learning at the end.

This was the most challenging course I have taken since my senior design project in Senior year of college.  I spent on average about 10-12 hours on each assignment (some much longer).

The assignments included:

* Classification w/Naive Bayes
* Classification w/SVM
* Smoothing Noise w/PCA
* More PCA
* Classifying w/Variable Length Inputs
* Outlier Detection
* Text bag-of-words Search and classification
* Classification with Artificial Neural Networks
* Variational Autoencoders
* Deep Neural Networks (Take-home Final)

The syllabus can be found at https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs498aml/sp2019/

All homeworks received 100% marks.
