This Phi Kappa Phi certificate and pin showed up in the mail today. Awesome timing as I submitted my final project last night for my final course of the Masterâ€™s of Computer Science program. I am quite honored and still looking forward to wearing this pin for a graduation ceremony in Champaign-Urbana someday. I was considering waiting until May 2021 even prior to Covid. I really hope we are able to have ceremonies by then.
