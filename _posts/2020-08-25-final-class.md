Finished the final course of the Master of Computer Science program, CS 513: Theory and Practice of Data Cleaning. This course is a joint effort with the Library and Information Sciences (LIS) department and the CS department. Which was awesome for me since there was a point where I considered continuing on after undergrad to the LIS Masters program at UIUC. During the course of this class, I was introduced to a number of tools. My favorite was OpenRefine, which an open source tool initially from Google with a lot of options to clean data. For my final project I worked on the data that was crowd sourced by the NYPL on with over 1 million menu items from over 17,000 menus. This data is super messy as it is input by anyone, however can also tell a lot of interesting stories over the last 120+ years. The project itself was humbling and brought my personal Mac to itâ€™s knees many times even feeding over half of the 32 GB of RAM. This project helped show me that truly 80% or more of the time is spent on cleaning the data to answer a simple research question.
