I am now Microsoft Certified in Azure AI Fundamentals. This was a fun one to study for and my first ever Microsoft Certification. I used all the free Azure training available for the AI services in from the Microsoft website. Very interesting to find out what is available with minimal work in the area of Vision, Speech, Language, Knowledge and Search. I was blown away by how some of these services are already being used for accessibility and improving quality of life for disabled people.
