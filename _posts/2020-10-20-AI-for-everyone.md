I just completed the "AI for Everyone" course from DeepLearning.AI. This is an excellent course for outlining what you currently can (and cannot) do with AI. I would totally recommend this to everyone. It is helpful to have this background when making decisions on where and when to invest in AI and machine learning. This is a great course to share with leadership because it is extremely accessible and not overly technical. Andrew Ng does a phenomenal job explaining some really incredible concepts.
