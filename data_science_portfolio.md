# Data Science Portfolio

I am currently a graduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (the [#5 Computer Science program in the nation](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings)), working on a Master's in Computer Science with a focus on Data Science. I am maintaining a a GPA of 4.0. This page is a compilation of the work that I can share publicly. I am also working on a couple of models at work that I cannot share publicly, but can discuss privately.

## Machine Learning

### [Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network Paper](/images/portfolio/Oculum_afficit.pdf)

[<img align="left" src="/images/portfolio/deep_learning_paper.PNG" hspace="20">](/images/portfolio/Oculum_afficit.pdf)

This was an awesome project where I worked with a research group to train a supervised Convolutional Neural Network model on 122 GB of photographs from [AffectNet](http://mohammadmahoor.com/affectnet/) using PySpark, Pandas, OpenCV, Keras, NumPy, and a whole lotta cloud compute.

Check out my group's full [research paper](/images/portfolio/Oculum_afficit.pdf).

### [Machine Learning Class](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12iauR6WPjcEejtAY-qS_s3DTVVUCN1LX)

[<img align="left" src="/images/portfolio/hw8_tensor_board.PNG" hspace="20">](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12iauR6WPjcEejtAY-qS_s3DTVVUCN1LX)

This is by far one of my favorite classes I have ever taken. We covered [many topics](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs498aml/sp2019/) from Principal Component Analysis to Classification with Artificial Neural Networks with PyTorch and many other topics.

View my code and discussion here:
* [Principal Component Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13NjeraDoDESv_lXErcTi71n1XdQ2jmVi)
* [Classification with Artificial Neural Networks with PyTorch](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12iauR6WPjcEejtAY-qS_s3DTVVUCN1LX)
* [Full python code](https://gitlab.com/aaronblythe/applied_machine_learning) available upon request (we have been asked to not share the code publicly in git).

### [Linear Regression Class](/images/portfolio/Data_Analysis.html)

[<img align="left" src="/images/portfolio/california_data_analysis.PNG" hspace="20">](/images/portfolio/Data_Analysis.html)

In this class we covered a [number of topics](http://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/index.html) including linear regression and logistic regression.

In our group project we used the [1990 California Housing Data Set](/images/portfolio/Data_Analysis.html) to work create a predictive model.

* [logistic regression](/images/portfolio/w10-hw-ablythe.html)
* [Full R code](https://gitlab.com/aaronblythe/stat420) of all my assignments for this class available upon request (we have been asked to not share the code publicly in git).

## Data Visualization

### [Tableau Visualization of CO2 by Country](https://public.tableau.com/profile/aaron.blythe#!/vizhome/CO2EmissionsperCountryWDIData/Dashboard)

[<img align="left" src="/images/portfolio/tableau_co2.PNG" hspace="20">](https://public.tableau.com/profile/aaron.blythe#!/vizhome/CO2EmissionsperCountryWDIData/Dashboard)

The dashboard I created shows the last 50 years of CO2 emissions per country across the world. The data is from the [World Development Indicators Data](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators).

### [D3 Dashboard using Pok√©mon Data](https://aaronblythe.gitlab.io/page/pokemon_d3/)

[<img align="left" src="/images/portfolio/pokemon_D3.PNG" hspace="20">](https://aaronblythe.gitlab.io/page/pokemon_d3/)

This was a fun dashboard to show off animations and interactions of elements in a D3 set of dashboards.

## Text and Voice

### [Voice Controlled ChatOps Using Alexa, Hubot, and Tool API's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nctOtUj41VQ)

[<img align="left" src="/images/portfolio/alexa_chatops.PNG" hspace="20">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nctOtUj41VQ)

I was able to create the ability to speak to my full on-call tool set using Alexa, Hubot, PagerDuty API, New Relic API and Sumologic API. It was awesome to get to present this on an IMAX screen in front of a full theater of 500 people.

Check out my [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nctOtUj41VQ).

### [Sentiment Analysis through Natural Language Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5xGwsJ76dw)

[<img align="left" src="/images/portfolio/sentipy.PNG" hspace="20">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5xGwsJ76dw)

In this project we mined Twitter for tweets about companies in the airline industry. We used indicators of where the tweet originated to plot the sentiment on a map. This was done in pure Python; if I were to do this again, I would do this in a Jupyter notebook as opposed to multiple Python scripts.
